# Smart Traffic Control System

**Tagline:** Smart Traffic 4-Ways Intersection Controller with Emergency Override and Adaptive Timing

## 1. Project Description

### Overview

This project is a smart traffic control system designed to optimize traffic light cycles based on real-time data and pedestrian crossing support, with special prioritization for emergency vehicles. By dynamically adjusting green-light timings, it aims to reduce congestion and enable emergency vehicles to navigate intersections more efficiently.

### Problem Statement
Urban areas face significant traffic congestion, often resulting in delays for emergency vehicles at intersections. This project addresses this problem by automatically adjusting traffic lights to prioritize emergency vehicles and manage vehicle density more effectively.

## 2. Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Control:** Dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on real-time vehicle density at each intersection.
- **Emergency Vehicle Detection and Prioritization:** Detects emergency vehicles on the road and grants them a green signal to pass through without delay.
- **Adaptive Timing Mechanism:** Uses the vehicle count and rate of increase on each road to calculate optimized green-light durations.
